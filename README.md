.vim
====

This configuration setup allows me work faster with editing ordinary files to
write codes like in IDE(competition, fast overview, grepping, ...).

When I started with Vim there was *no* IDE good for Linux kernel programming and
over the time I started to use Vim everywhere.

Thank you guys (Miroslav Bend√≠k and Tomas Baca) for initial inspiration of
your *.vimrc* files.

## How to clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/Kaisrlik/.vim.git

## Installation

Just call a `make` :]

**WARN**: If you will call `make istall` it will relink base configuration file
like `~/.vim/` to this repo.

In any case I strongly recommend to take a look what [Makefile](Makefile) contains.
